# Add persistent memories for the agent
memories:
  - "Always prioritize modular architecture and code reuse over rewriting functionality"
  - "Analyze existing code and components before implementing new functionality"
  - "Apply DRY principle - extract common functionality into reusable modules"
  - "Prefer composition over inheritance and keep components focused on single responsibility"
  - "Use pure functions with no side effects for better testability and reusability"
  - "When uncertain about architecture decisions, ask user directly for guidance via chat"
  - "Avoid monolithic components, tightly coupled code, and complex inheritance hierarchies"
  - "Define explicit interfaces and type contracts for all components"
# Example:
# memories:
#   - "User prefers detailed technical explanations"
#   - "Current project uses React and TypeScript"

# Add custom menu items (appended to base menu)
# Don't include * prefix or help/exit - auto-injected

#     description: My custom workflow

# Add custom prompts (for action="#id" handlers)
