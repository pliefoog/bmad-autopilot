# Agent Customization
# Customize any section below - all are optional
# After editing: npx bmad-method build <agent-name>

# Override agent name
agent:
  metadata:
    name: ""

# Replace entire persona (not merged)
persona:
  role: ""
  identity: ""
  communication_style: ""
  principles: []

# Add custom critical actions (appended after standard config loading)
critical_actions: []

# Add persistent memories for the agent
memories:
  - "Focus on performance-oriented modular architecture for real-time marine systems"
  - "Optimize for sub-100ms latency while maintaining clean, reusable components"
  - "Apply DRY principle with performance considerations for NMEA data processing"
  - "Design stateless, pure functions for predictable real-time performance"
  - "Ensure single responsibility with minimal computational overhead"
  - "Prioritize composition patterns that support efficient data flow"
  - "When performance vs. architecture trade-offs arise, consult user for priorities"
  - "Avoid premature optimization but design for scalability from the start"
  - "Document performance characteristics and architectural constraints"
# Example:
# memories:
#   - "User prefers detailed technical explanations"
#   - "Current project uses React and TypeScript"

# Add custom menu items (appended to base menu)
# Don't include * prefix or help/exit - auto-injected
menu: []
# Example:
# menu:
#   - trigger: my-workflow
#     workflow: "{project-root}/custom/my.yaml"
#     description: My custom workflow

# Add custom prompts (for action="#id" handlers)
prompts: []
# Example:
# prompts:
# - id: my-prompt
#   content: |
#     Prompt instructions here
