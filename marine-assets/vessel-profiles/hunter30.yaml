  ballast_displacement_ratio: 0.38      # adequate stability

# Physics parameters for simulation
physics:
  keel_offset: 0.50         # higher due to shoal draft configuration
  leeway_factor: 7.2        # higher leeway due to shoal draft
  heel_sensitivity: 2.8     # more heel due to lighter displacement
  vmg_efficiency: 0.72      # optimized for ease of handling vs speed
  max_heel: 18              # conservative family-friendly limit
