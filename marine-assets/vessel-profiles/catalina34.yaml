  leeway_factor: 6.1        # higher due to fuller hull sections
  heel_sensitivity: 2.2     # more heel due to higher center of gravity
  vmg_efficiency: 0.78      # lower efficiency, optimized for comfort
  max_heel: 20              # conservative comfort limit
  stall_angle: 45           # earlier stall due to cruising rig
