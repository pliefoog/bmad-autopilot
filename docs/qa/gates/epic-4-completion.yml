summary: |
  Epic 4 Alarms & Polish has not been started. This epic is SAFETY-CRITICAL for marine
  environments as it implements alarm systems that match physical instrument capabilities.
  No stories have been initiated, no QA gates exist. Immediate attention required to
  establish alarm reliability testing framework before development begins.
