summary: |
  Epic 5 Quality & Launch preparation shows minimal progress. Quality gate infrastructure
  exists but lacks systematic implementation. App Store compliance planning incomplete.
  Critical quality metrics (99.5% crash-free rate, 98% connection success) have no
  continuous monitoring framework. Launch readiness assessment framework missing.
