  overall_score: 2
  recommendations:
    must_fix: []
    monitor: [
      "Monitor memory usage during extended debugging sessions",
      "Watch for new NMEA sentence types requiring support",
      "Validate performance with real marine network conditions",
      "Consider adding more sentence types (RMC, MTW) as needed"
    ]

# Implementation strengths noted
strengths:
  - "Field-level throttling prevents UI thrashing while maintaining responsiveness"
  - "Memory-managed raw sentence debugging (100-item circular buffer)"
  - "Comprehensive error handling ensures marine navigation system stability"
  - "Real-world test scenarios including burst loads and malformed data"
  - "Full TypeScript integration with proper NMEA data interfaces"

# Test coverage analysis
test_analysis:
  total_tests: 68
  coverage_core: "97.61% on nmeaStore.ts"
  coverage_services: "54.31% on nmeaConnection.ts (critical paths covered)"
  scenarios_covered:
    - "Valid NMEA parsing (VTG, GGA sentence types)"
    - "Malformed data handling (garbage data, invalid checksums)"
    - "Throttling mechanism (field-level rate limiting)"
    - "Performance validation (500 message burst test)"
    - "Debug mode functionality (raw sentence capture)"
    - "Memory management (100-item limit validation)"

# Marine safety compliance
marine_safety:
  error_handling: "Comprehensive try-catch prevents navigation system crashes"
  data_validation: "nmea-simple library provides checksum validation"
  performance: "Throttling tested at production NMEA message rates"
  debugging: "Raw sentence capture enables production troubleshooting"
  memory_safety: "Bounded storage prevents memory leaks during extended operations"
