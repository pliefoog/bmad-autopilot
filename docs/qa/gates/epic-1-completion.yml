notes: |
  Epic 1 represents a highly successful foundation phase with all strategic objectives
  achieved through systematic execution. The technical foundation is solid, the autopilot
  path is validated, and the development infrastructure enables efficient Epic 2 execution.
  Quality scores consistently above 85 indicate mature implementation practices.
