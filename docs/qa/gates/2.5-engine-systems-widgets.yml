summary: |
  MAJOR IMPLEMENTATION TRANSFORMATION: Engine systems widgets have been completely 
  rebuilt from minimal text displays to comprehensive marine monitoring systems. 
  EngineWidget, BatteryWidget, and TanksWidget now provide professional-grade 
  functionality with visual gauges, safety warning systems, multi-engine/battery 
  support, and marine industry standard thresholds. Excellent marine safety focus 
  with critical parameter monitoring. Production-ready with minor test enhancements.
