# NEXT STEPS TO ACHIEVE PASS STATUS
next_actions:
  immediate:
    - "✅ COMPLETED: Created autopilot integration test suite (280+ lines covering command flows)"
    - "✅ COMPLETED: Added widget command status propagation tests (285+ lines)"  
    - "⏳ REMAINING: Validate PGN message encoding with real NMEA2000 data samples (0.5 day effort)"
  
  hardware_preparation:
    - "Document Raymarine Evolution hardware testing protocol"
    - "Create autopilot simulator for hardware-less testing"
    - "Establish hardware-in-the-loop testing framework"
    
  production_readiness:
    - "Performance testing under NMEA message load (500+ msg/sec)"
    - "Marine safety certification review"
    - "End-to-end system validation with real boat scenarios"

# TIMELINE TO PASS STATUS
estimated_completion: "2-3 days for immediate actions + 1 week for hardware testing"
success_criteria:
  - "Autopilot integration test suite passing 100%"
  - "Command status propagation verified in widget tests"
  - "PGN encoding validated with real data samples"
  - "Hardware-in-the-loop testing framework established"
