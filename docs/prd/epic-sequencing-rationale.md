# Epic Sequencing Rationale

**Why this revised order?**

1. **Epic 1: Autopilot spike moved to Month 1** - De-risks highest technical unknown early. If protocol doesn't work, we know by Month 1 (not Month 5), saving 4 months of wasted effort.

2. **Epic 1: Playback mode in Month 1** - Enables continuous testing from Epic 2 onward. Can't properly test widgets without NMEA data source.

3. **Epic 2: All 10 widgets by Month 3** - Merged original Epic 4 here. Accelerates value delivery, enables comprehensive beta testing in Epic 3-4.

4. **Epic 3: Closed beta starts Month 4** - Get real-world feedback early (not waiting until Month 7). 10 early adopters with Raymarine EVO systems validate autopilot.

5. **Epic 4: Alarms + UX polish in Month 6** - Complete feature set before public launch. Beta expands to 50 users for comprehensive feedback.

6. **Epic 5: Quality gates + Launch in Month 7** - Focus solely on achieving quality standards and App Store compliance. No new features.

**Key Improvements Over Original:**
- ✅ Autopilot risk de-risked 3 months earlier
- ✅ Testing infrastructure built in Month 1 (not Month 3)
- ✅ All 10 widgets delivered 2.5 months earlier
- ✅ Beta testing starts Month 4 (not Month 7) - 3 months more feedback
- ✅ Continuous testing from Epic 2 onward (not back-loaded to Epic 6)
