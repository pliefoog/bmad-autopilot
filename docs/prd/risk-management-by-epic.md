# Risk Management by Epic

Each epic has explicit fallback strategies documented:

| Epic | Primary Risk | Fallback Strategy | Impact |
|------|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| Epic 1 | NMEA connectivity fails | Reassess tech approach, evaluate different libraries | CRITICAL - project fails |
| Epic 1 | Autopilot protocol incomplete | Document gaps, pivot to instruments-only MVP | Major - lose key differentiator |
| Epic 2 | Widget complexity causes delay | Reduce to 7-8 widgets, defer 2-3 to Phase 1.5 | Minor - still viable MVP |
| Epic 3 | Autopilot control fails Month 5 gate | Final decision: Instruments-only MVP | Major - lose key differentiator |
| Epic 4 | Grouped alarm UX too complex | Ship simple threshold alarms only | Minor - alarms still functional |
| Epic 5 | Quality gates not met | Extend beta 2-4 weeks, delay launch | Minor - timeline slip acceptable |
