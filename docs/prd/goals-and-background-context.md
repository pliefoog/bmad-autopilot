# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Launch a functional MVP of the Boating Instruments App within 7 months that transforms smartphones, tablets, and desktop devices into comprehensive marine instrument displays and autopilot controllers
- Enable solo/short-handed sailors to safely monitor all critical boat parameters and control autopilot from any location on the vessel without requiring additional hardware beyond existing WiFi bridges
- Provide powerboaters with comprehensive engine and systems monitoring through customizable widget-based dashboards that adapt to any screen size
- Achieve 99.5% crash-free session rate and 98%+ NMEA connection success rate across multiple WiFi bridge models, establishing reliability standards matching physical marine instruments
- Acquire 50 beta users (Month 6-7) and 150 paying users by Month 12 at $79.99 one-time purchase pricing, generating $12,000 revenue
- Establish credibility through 10+ documented successful Raymarine Evolution autopilot control sessions with video proof before public launch

## Background Context

Recreational boating instruments have remained largely unchanged for decades. Physical marine instruments—depth gauges, speed displays, wind instruments, autopilot controllers—are reliable but suffer from inherent limitations: they're fixed-location devices that can only be viewed from their mounted position, display single functions, offer limited customization, provide no historical data, and are expensive to expand ($200-$800+ per additional display plus installation). Solo sailors must leave the helm to check instruments at the nav station, taking attention away from boat handling. Powerboaters at enclosed helm stations cannot easily monitor instruments mounted outside. The market gap is clear: boaters carry powerful smartphones and tablets on board with better displays and interfaces than their dedicated instruments, and WiFi bridges that expose NMEA data are becoming standard equipment, yet no comprehensive app exists that truly replicates the full suite of dedicated instruments (particularly autopilot control) with modern conveniences.

The Boating Instruments App addresses this by connecting to existing boat NMEA networks via WiFi bridges, providing a widget-based dashboard architecture where users compose their ideal instrument layout. The MVP focuses on 10 core instrument widgets (depth, speed, wind, GPS, compass, engine, battery, tanks, autopilot status, rudder) plus full Raymarine Evolution autopilot control via touch interface, display modes (day/night/red-night), basic alarms, and cross-platform support (iOS, Android, Windows, Mac). Voice commands and trip logging—originally considered for MVP—have been deferred to Phase 2 to reduce complexity and ensure launch timeline is achievable.
