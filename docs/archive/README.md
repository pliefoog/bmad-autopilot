# Archived Documentation

This directory contains documentation that has been superseded or is no longer actively maintained but preserved for historical reference.

## Archive Organization

Documentation is archived when:
- It has been superseded by newer documentation
- The feature/implementation it describes has been refactored
- It contains outdated architectural decisions
- It's session-specific implementation notes that are complete

## Current Archives

*(Files will be added here during the unified sensor schema refactor)*

- `/docs/architecture/` - Current system architecture
- `/docs/guides/` - Developer guides
- `/docs/api/` - API documentation
