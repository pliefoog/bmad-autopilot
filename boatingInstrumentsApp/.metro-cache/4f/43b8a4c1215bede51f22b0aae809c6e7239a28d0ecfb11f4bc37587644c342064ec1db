Reception of this PGN may also be used to maintain an address to NAME association table within the receiving device.  The transmission interval may be used by the receiving unit to determine the time-out value for the connection supervision.  The value contained in Field 1 of this PGN reflects the PGN's current Transmission Interval. Changes to this PGN's Transmission Interval shall be reflected in Field 1.  The transmission interval can only be changed by using the Request Group Function PGN 126208 with no pairs of request parameters provided. Field 3 of the Request Group Function PGN 126208 may contain values between 1,000ms and 60,000ms.  This PGN cannot be requested by the ISO Request PGN 059904 or Request Group Function PGN 126208.

The Command Group Function PGN 126208 shall not be used with this PGN.  Fields 3 and 4 of this PGN provide information which can be used to distinguish short duration disturbances from permanent failures.
