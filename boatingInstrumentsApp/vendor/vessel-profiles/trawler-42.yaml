# Performance characteristics
performance:
  hull_speed: 8.6                       # displacement hull speed limit
  cruise_speed: 7.5                     # knots - efficient trawling speed
  max_speed: 9.2                        # knots - near hull speed
  fuel_consumption_cruise: 2.8          # gallons per hour - very efficient
  fuel_consumption_max: 5.5             # gallons per hour at max
  range_cruise: 1600                    # nautical miles - exceptional range

# Physics parameters for simulation (displacement hull)
physics:
  turning_radius: 180       # feet - larger turning radius
  acceleration: 0.8         # knots per second - slow acceleration
  deceleration: 2.0         # knots per second - gradual deceleration
  wind_drift_factor: 1.2    # higher windage due to size
  current_efficiency: 0.85  # moderate efficiency against current
  wave_impact: 0.8          # excellent seakeeping, less speed loss

# Engine specifications
engine:
  type: "single_diesel"
  total_horsepower: 210     # single engine
  cruising_rpm: 1800        # low RPM for efficiency
  max_rpm: 2400
  fuel_flow_cruise: 2.8     # gallons per hour

# Environmental operating limits
limits:
  max_wind_speed: 45        # knots - excellent seaworthiness
