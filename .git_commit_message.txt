feat(sensors): unified metrics schema V4 migration

Phase 1: Data Structure Unification - Step 1-2 Complete

BREAKING CHANGE: SensorConfiguration now requires metrics object for all sensors

Changes:
- Updated SensorConfiguration interface (src/types/SensorData.ts):
  - Removed top-level threshold fields (critical, warning, direction, etc.)
  - Made metrics object required (previously optional)
  - Added MetricConfiguration interface for type safety
  - All sensors (single + multi-metric) use unified metrics object

- Implemented V3→V4 migration (src/store/sensorConfigStore.ts):
  - Bumped schema version 3→4
  - Single-metric sensors: Wrap top-level thresholds → metrics[fieldName]
  - Multi-metric sensors: Preserve existing metrics object
  - User-friendly success toast on migration
  - Fallback to clean slate for V0-V2 (incompatible schema)

Migration Example:
- V3: { critical: 2.0, warning: 3.0, enabled: true }
- V4: { metrics: { depth: { critical: 2.0, warning: 3.0, enabled: true } } }

Benefits:
- Eliminates dual code paths (single vs multi-metric conditionals)
- ~300 lines of conditional logic can now be removed
- MetricSelector always rendered (disabled for single-metric)
- Type-safe metrics access via MetricConfiguration interface

Next Steps:
- Update SensorInstance methods to use metrics object
- Update schemaDefaults.ts to write to metrics
- Simplify useSensorConfigForm (remove conditionals)
- Simplify SensorConfigDialog (unified rendering)
