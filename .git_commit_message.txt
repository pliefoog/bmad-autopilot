fix(sensor-config): centralize validatedMetric to prevent flickering

CRITICAL FIX: Slider was flickering when switching battery metrics (e.g., current → temperature) because multiple useMemos were independently resolving watchedMetric || defaultMetric, causing inconsistent metric resolution during React render cycles.

Root Cause:
- enrichedThresholds used: watchedMetric || defaultMetric
- alarmConfig used: watchedMetric || defaultMetric (with guard)
- sliderPresentation used: watchedMetric || defaultMetric
- alarmFormula used: watchedMetric || defaultMetric
- ratioUnit used: watchedMetric || defaultMetric
- Each could resolve to different values during sensor/metric switches
- Temperature has direct thresholds, but "current" (previous metric) had indirectThreshold (ratio mode)
- ThresholdPresentationService would flip between ratio/direct modes → flickering slider

Solution:
- Created single validatedMetric useMemo (lines 333-342)
- Validates metric belongs to current sensor's alarmFieldKeys
- Falls back to alarmFieldKeys[0] if stale/invalid
- All consumers now use validatedMetric (single source of truth):
  * enrichedThresholds (line 345)
  * alarmConfig (line 362)
  * sliderPresentation (line 394, 407)
  * alarmFormula (line 411, 419)
  * ratioUnit (line 425, 437)
  * metricLabel (line 531)

Result:
- Consistent metric resolution across all useMemos
- No flickering during sensor/metric switches
- Simpler dependency arrays
- Future-proof against stale metric bugs
