refactor: remove SensorContext interface and backward compatibility

Step 4 of threshold slider refactor.

Deleted deprecated SensorContext interface from SensorData.ts:
- Interface defined battery/engineType specific context fields
- Replaced with generic string context pattern
- Schema-driven contextKey field determines context type

Removed backward compatibility code from useSensorConfigForm.ts:
- Deleted object→string context conversion in form initialization
- Deleted object→string context normalization in enrichedThresholds
- Context is now always a string ('agm', 'diesel', etc.)
- Migration happens automatically in store hydration (Step 2)

Clean architecture enforced:
- No sensor-specific hardcoded logic
- Schema contextKey determines context field name
- Single string value for all context types
- Type safety maintained with schema validation
