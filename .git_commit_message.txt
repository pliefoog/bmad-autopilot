fix: slider presentation for single-metric sensors (depth)

Problem: Slider didn't render for depth sensor because sliderPresentation was null

Root Cause:
- Depth is single-metric sensor (requiresMetricSelection = false)
- watchedMetric is undefined for single-metric sensors
- sliderPresentation only checked watchedMetric
- alarmConfig correctly used: metric || alarmFieldKeys[0]

Solution:
- Use same logic in all computed values
- metricKey = requiresMetricSelection ? watchedMetric : alarmFieldKeys[0]
- Applied to: sliderPresentation, alarmFormula, ratioUnit
- Now consistent with alarmConfig logic

Files:
- useSensorConfigForm.ts: Fixed sliderPresentation, alarmFormula, ratioUnit logic

Result: Slider now renders for both single-metric (depth) and multi-metric (battery) sensors
