feat: dynamic threshold recalculation when dependencies change

Implements automatic re-resolution of formula-based thresholds when dependency
values change at runtime (e.g., capacity, temperature, nominalVoltage).

Key Changes:
- Added _recalculateFormulaDependentThresholds() method to SensorInstance
- Triggered after each updateMetrics() call that changes values
- Detects formula-based thresholds by checking for indirectThreshold field
- Re-resolves formulas using current metric values as context
- Updates resolved min/max values while preserving original ratio
- Re-evaluates alarms with new threshold values

Example Use Cases:
- Battery current threshold (capacity * 1.5 C-rate): Recalculates when capacity changes
- Voltage threshold with temperature compensation: Recalculates when temperature changes
- RPM thresholds based on engine parameters: Recalculates when maxRpm changes

Architecture:
- SensorInstance.updateMetrics() → detects changes → calls recalculation
- Recalculation iterates MetricThresholds, finds formula-based (has indirectThreshold)
- Builds context from current metric values (capacity, temperature, etc.)
- Calls resolveThreshold() with updated context
- Updates critical.min/max or warning.min/max with new resolved value
- Preserves critical.indirectThreshold (user's original ratio)
- Re-evaluates alarm states with new thresholds

Benefits:
- Voltage thresholds stay accurate as temperature changes
- Current limits scale automatically when capacity is reconfigured
- No manual threshold updates needed when dependencies change
- Seamless user experience with dynamic adjustments
