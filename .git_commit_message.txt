fix: SensorInstance.name is property not method - fix dialog error

Fixed runtime error in SensorConfigDialog after useFormState migration.

Error: "sensorInstance?.getName is not a function"
Location: SensorConfigDialog.tsx:251

Root Cause:
- SensorInstance class has public `name` property, not `getName()` method
- Dialog was calling `sensorInstance?.getName()` which doesn't exist
- This worked before but broke during form state migration refactor

Fix:
- Changed `sensorInstance?.getName()` to `sensorInstance?.name`
- Direct property access (correct pattern for SensorInstance)

Verification:
- Zero TypeScript errors
- Compiles successfully
- Web dev server running without errors

File: SensorConfigDialog.tsx
Change: 1 line (method call → property access)
