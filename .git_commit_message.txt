docs: add performance measurement guide for Phase 1 optimizations

Created comprehensive guide for measuring impact of completed optimizations:

Phase 1.1 - Dialog Lazy Loading:
- Bundle size analysis (expected 100-150KB reduction)
- Network tab verification of code-splitting
- Initial load time comparison

Phase 1.2 - Store Selector Optimization:
- React DevTools Profiler scenarios
- HeaderBar re-render test (expect 98-99% reduction)
- ConnectionConfigDialog re-render test

Includes:
- Step-by-step measurement procedures
- Expected results for each optimization
- Before/after performance benchmarks
- Recommendations for Phase 2 (optional technical debt)
