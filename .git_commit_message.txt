fix(sensor-config): make slider rail span full width with flex: 1

Problem:
- Slider rail only visible between thumbs (53.0 to 64.0)
- Rail should extend full width from min (0.0) to max (100.0)
- Visual issue: rail appeared truncated

Root Cause:
- rail style missing flex: 1 property
- Without flex: 1, rail doesn't expand to fill available space
- RangeSlider library requires rail to have proper dimensions

Solution:
- Add flex: 1 to rail style
- Ensures rail expands to full container width
- Matches old implementation approach

Visual Result:
- Rail now spans from 0.0 to 100.0 (full range)
- Gray baseline visible across entire width
- Blue selected section between thumbs
- Proper end-to-end slider appearance
