chore: install error handling and debounce dependencies

Step 3 of threshold slider refactor.

Installed packages:
- react-error-boundary: Generic ErrorBoundary for React Native
  Used to wrap AlarmThresholdSlider with graceful error handling
  
- use-debounce: React hook for debounced callbacks
  Used for 150ms debounced formula evaluation during slider drag
  Prevents performance issues with high-frequency updates

Both packages support React Native and follow React hook patterns.
