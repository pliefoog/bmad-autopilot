feat: add mobile breakpoint and responsive spacing tokens

Step 1 of threshold slider refactor.

Added MOBILE_BREAKPOINT constant (400px) based on mobile research:
- Most common mobile widths: 360px-430px
- 360px most popular at 10.56%
- 400px chosen for responsive breakpoint
- Distinct from tablet breakpoint (768px)

Added flattened responsive spacing tokens for threshold slider:
- thresholdHintMobile/Desktop: 12/16px
- thresholdLegendGapMobile/Desktop: 8/12px
- rangeLabelMobile/Desktop: 9/11px

Tokens follow 4pt grid system, will be used in AlarmThresholdSlider
for responsive layout switching at 400px breakpoint.
