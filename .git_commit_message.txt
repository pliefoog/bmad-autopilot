feat: add silent context format migration

Step 2 of threshold slider refactor.

Added migrateOldContextFormat() utility function:
- Detects old object format: { batteryChemistry: 'agm' }
- Converts to new string format: 'agm'
- Type-safe with isOldContextFormat() type guard
- Extracts first property value from object

Integrated into store hydration:
- Runs automatically during AsyncStorage hydration
- Silent migration with no user notification
- Logs migration count for debugging
- Prevents data corruption from deprecated format

This ensures backward compatibility during transition while
maintaining clean architecture going forward.
