docs: add comprehensive architectural optimization review

Senior architect-level code audit identifying optimization opportunities:

Document created: ARCHITECTURAL-OPTIMIZATION-REVIEW-2026.md

Key Findings:
1. Barrel export pattern (types/index.ts) could be optimized
2. No code-splitting for dialogs (~3500 lines loaded eagerly)
3. Dialog form state has some duplication potential
4. Store selectors need audit (may have overly broad subscriptions)
5. Object pooling considered but likely premature optimization

Priority Recommendations:
- Phase 1 (Quick Wins): Add lazy loading to dialogs for 100KB bundle reduction
- Phase 2 (Technical Debt): Extract useDialogForm hook to reduce duplication
- Phase 3 (Future): Monitor MetricValue allocation if GC becomes issue

Already Well-Architected:
- BaseConfigDialog pattern eliminates 260+ lines per dialog
- Registry-first widget architecture
- Explicit props over context (Jan 2025 refactor)
- Zustand with DevTools for observable state
- PlatformTokens for centralized theming
- Conditional logging with zero overhead

Assessment: Code is production-ready with mature architectural patterns.
All optimizations are incremental improvements, not architectural issues.
