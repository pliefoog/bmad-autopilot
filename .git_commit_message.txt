fix: indirectThreshold architecture - store both resolved and ratio values

CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE FIX:
- MetricThresholds now stores BOTH resolved min/max (for alarms/TrendLine) AND original indirectThreshold (for UI editing and recalculation when dependencies change)
- Alarm evaluation uses resolved min/max values with hysteresis
- TrendLine displays resolved threshold lines (not ratios)
- SensorConfigDialog edits the indirectThreshold ratio value
- Future: Support recalculation when dependency values change (e.g., voltage threshold when temperature changes)

Implementation Details:
1. MetricThresholds.critical/warning: Added comments clarifying min/max for alarms, indirectThreshold for UI/recalc
2. SensorInstance.convertToMetricThresholds: Stores BOTH resolved value and original ratio
3. ThresholdPresentationService: Reads indirectThreshold from runtime thresholds (now available)
4. nmeaStore.updateSensorThresholds: Simplified to call updateThresholdsFromConfig which handles all conversion

Data Flow:
- Storage: MetricConfiguration.indirectThreshold = { critical: 1.5, warning: 1.0 }
- Runtime: MetricThresholds.critical = { max: 225, indirectThreshold: 1.5 }
  - max: Resolved value (150Ah × 1.5 C-rate = 225A) - used by alarms/TrendLine
  - indirectThreshold: Original ratio - used by UI and future recalculation
- Alarm: evaluateAlarm checks critical.max (225A) against current value
- TrendLine: Displays horizontal line at resolved threshold (225A)
- Dialog: Slider shows indirectThreshold ratio (1.5 C-rate)
