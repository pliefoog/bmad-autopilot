debug: Add logging to trace effective threshold calculation

Added comprehensive debug logging to identify why formula evaluation isn't
producing effective threshold values. User reports that slider shows ratio
values with correct unit symbol (e.g., "1.5 A") instead of calculated
values (e.g., "225 A").

Changes:
- AlarmThresholdSlider: Fix isRatioMode to check formulaContext directly
  (was checking old formula && sensorMetrics props)
- AlarmThresholdSlider: Add __DEV__ logging to calculateEffectiveValue()
  to trace formula evaluation inputs and results
- ThresholdPresentationService: Add logging when computing formula context
  to verify parameters are being extracted correctly
- ThresholdPresentationService: Add logging at return point to verify
  formulaContext is being included in result

This will help identify:
1. Is formulaContext being computed in service?
2. Is formulaContext being passed to slider?
3. Is isRatioMode being detected correctly?
4. Is formula evaluation working?
